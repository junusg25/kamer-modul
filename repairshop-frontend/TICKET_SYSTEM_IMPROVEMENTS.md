## Migration Guide

### For Existing Routes
The new unified system maintains backward compatibility while providing new unified routes:

**Old Routes (Still Supported)**:
- `/repair-tickets` → Redirects to `/ticket-management?tab=2`
- `/warranty-repair-tickets` → Redirects to `/ticket-management?tab=1`
- `/create-repair-ticket` → Redirects to `/create-ticket?type=non-warranty`
- `/create-warranty-repair-ticket` → Redirects to `/create-ticket?type=warranty`

**New Unified Routes**:
- `/ticket-management` → Main ticket management interface
- `/ticket-management/:type/:id` → Unified ticket detail view
- `/create-ticket` → Unified ticket creation form

### Implementation Notes
1. **URL Parameters**: Use `?type=warranty` or `?type=non-warranty` for ticket type
2. **Tab Navigation**: Use `?tab=0` (All), `?tab=1` (Warranty), `?tab=2` (Non-warranty)
3. **Breadcrumbs**: Automatic breadcrumb generation based on current route
4. **Permissions**: Role-based access control maintained across all components

## Future Enhancements
